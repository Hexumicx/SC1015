# Predicting the crypto market

## About

This is a Mini-Project for CS1015 in which we try to predict the biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and we further tested our model's capabilities on smaller cryptocurrency, Dogecoin.

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict the change in price of Bitcoin?
- Is there a model that can result in a profit?

## Models Used

1. Ordinary least square Linear Regression
2. Long Short-term memory Neural Networks

## Conclusion
- Although linear regression has a good R^2 and MSE, it does not translate to a profit

## What did we learn from this project?
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Using Plotly to visualise candlestick plot
